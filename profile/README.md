# The Dockware Mirror

This GitHub space provides GHCR mirrors for dockware images.

DockerHub is lowering the rate limits for anonymous users more and more. 
Dockware if often used to develop and test against multiple Shopware versions and it's also often used in pipelines.

The images of this space can be used as an image source if any project hits the DockerHub rate limits.

## Up-to-dateness

The images are updated in soon to be determined intervals. Manual updates will be done, too.

This project is not affiliated with Dockware or Shopware.
